# Analysis of Sleep Data

I have been collecting my sleep data since July of 2016. Using the app SleepCycle, each night records several types of data (which you can read about in [SleepCycle's Privacy Policy](https://www.sleepcycle.com/privacy-policy-2021/#:~:text=When%20using%20the%20Sleep%20Cycle,as%20snoring%20or%20other%20noises)). For this project, I focused only on 12 of the data values collected. Specifically I was interested in Sleep Quality, how it was affected, and if I could predict what my future sleep quality would be like.

## Basic Findings

In addition to not walking nearly enough on average (I don't have a smart watch, so steps are recorded with my phone. When I don't carry my phone with me, no steps are tracked so don't judge me too hard), I discovered that my sleep quality is... not great.
On average, I spend **6 hours 31 minutes and 58 seconds** in bed. **5 hours 52 minutes and 4 seconds** of that time I spend asleep. The average temperature outside is **43.37** Â°Fahrenheit (chilly!). I set an alarm **70.81%** of the time, take an average of **2512.071** steps in the day (again, no judgment), and have an average sleep quality of **67.57%**.

## Process
### Original Dataset Summary
I began with a summary of the dataset's variables and their respective ranges, quartiles, and descriptive statistics. This gives gave me an idea of the kind of data I was dealing with. 

| Variable          | Min.   | 1st Qu. | Median | Mean   | 3rd Qu. | Max.    |
|-------------------|--------|---------|--------|--------|---------|---------|

### Training Data
I built a predictive model with SleepQuality as the dependent variable using **65%** of the original dataset. The goal was to identify the top predictors that could help predict SleepQuality. Here is the summary of the predictive model, which shows us the significant predictors based on their P-Value. These include Time in Bed, Time Asleep, Temperature, Alarm and Steps. These predictors are what I used to predict SleepQuality.

| Variable         	| Estimate   	| Std. Error 	| t value 	| Pr(>\|t\|)   	|
|------------------	|------------	|------------	|---------	|--------------	|
| (Intercept)      	| 4.830e+00  	| 1.265e+00  	| 3.818   	| 0.000141 *** 	|

| Temperature      	| 6.014e-02  	| 1.619e-02  	| 3.714   	| 0.000213 *** 	|

### Performance Metrics
In addition to identifying the top predictors, I calculated additional metrics to evaluate the performance of the predictive model. These metrics include:
* Total Sum of Squares (TSS): **875,662.8**
* Sum of Squares Regression (SSR): **762,789.7**
* Sum of Squares Error (SSE): **112,873.2**

The regression model successfully explains approximately 87.11% of the total variance in SleepQuality, as indicated by the Proportion of Total Sum of Squares Explained by Regression (SSR/TSS). This high percentage suggests that the model is fairly effective. However, there is still approximately **12.89%** of the differences in SleepQuality that remain unexplained, represented by the Sum of Squares Error (SSE).

To assess the overall significance of the regression model, I conducted an F-test, resulting in an F-value of **2626.134** and a corresponding p-value of **0**. This indicates that the model is statistically significant, suggesting that the predictors used in the model collectively have a substantial impact on SleepQuality.

Finally I created a histogram of the residuals to depict the differences between the predicted and actual values of SleepQuality. The histogram forms a bell-shaped curve, suggesting that the residuals follow a normal distribution. This indicates a good fit of the regression model to the data.

### Prediction
Finally, I could use my model to predict Sleep Quality. Assuming we take an average average person with respect to the five predictors in the regression model, we find that their sleep quality will be **67.57%**
